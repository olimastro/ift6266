Since it was already done in the Machine Learning class last semester, I instead tried my hand for the first time at Theano and implemented an MLP with it.\r\n\r\n### Week of the 1st of February and 8th of February\r\nI will concentrate my efforts on the Vocal Synthesis project. I familiarized myself with LSTM, installed blocks/fuel and started to try to understand how to use a simple LSTM for this task using blocks' framework.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
